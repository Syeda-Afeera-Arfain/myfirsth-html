		<p>n People who love cats are called Ailurophiles.I believe that a major reasons we love cats is because of an uncanny ability that few humans possess:they register our tactile presence
		in a deeply felt way.<br>They really know how to let us in!They are right there in the delectable moment receiving our touch.Most likely we don't judge cats as being selfish;we relish how 
		openly they let us in.
